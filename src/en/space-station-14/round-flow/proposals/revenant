Heavy inspiration from EmoGarbage's Specter antagonist. (https://github.com/space-wizards/docs/pull/262)

## Overview

With this proposal we aim to add more self-sufficiency to the Revenant, as well as make it more fleshed out.
Some existing abilities have been reworked to better fit with how this new Revenant plays out on top of having the shop expanded.
The Revenant is now extra susceptible to holy attacks, as per SlamBamActionman's PR.
The Revenant is now be able to possess harvest-prone players, taking over their body completely.
The Revenant can upgrade some of it's abilities in exchange of souls.
Player souls are ranked differently.

## Background

Currently, the Revenant is a mediocre mid-round antag ghost role, due to it's dependence on crew deaths, which are entirely beyond the Revenant's control.
The present gameplay loop usually consists of the Revenant having to visit med at least once in order to attain Stolen Essence, or pray for major disasters.
And even after having unlocked all abilities, there's not much going for the Revenant besides being a mild and repetitive annoyance.
What we bring you is a major re-design of the Revenant, which not only makes getting 'fun' abilities less of a grind, but tries to make it actually interact with the crew.

## MHP

The Revenant's HP will now be completely separate of the Soul Essence harvested.
MHP (Metaphysical Hitpoints) do not passively regenerate, making the only way to get them back through Soul Essence conversion.
There will be ways to upgrade the Revenant's MHP up to double its base amount.

## Soul ranking

Souls are now divided into 3 different grades: Low-value, Medium-value, and High-value
Low-value souls will be that of 'normal' personnel (Civillians, common Engineers, common Medics, et cetera)
Medium-value souls will be that of 'special' personnel (ie. Security Officers and Cadets, most of Command)
High-value souls will be that of 'unique' personnel (ie. Captain, Head of Security, Antagonists)
Your soul's essence will be dependent on it's grade, Low-value having the least base amount, and High-value having the most.
Players may rise through the rankings via killing other player-controlled humanoid characters.
