[Ninja headset & Agent ID improvement PR](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/pull/32841) 

## Overview

This proposal is aimed towards addressing some issues that Space Ninjas currently possess, as well as adding some extra flavour and other content.</p>
<p>New abilities and interactions have been added to better fit with the stealth-based gameplay the Space Ninja should have had. They now also come with an adequately themed satchel and a katana sheath, as well as a brand new ninja headset as per Alwayswannahunt's PR.</p>
<p>The Space Ninja's weapons have gotten a slight nerf as to not make them as prone to murder-boning.

## Background

Currently, albeit being an extremely fun mid-round antag role and definitely one of the better ones, I find that the Space Ninja isn't correctly geared towards what it should be the best at: Stealthing - Which is what this document hopes to address, mostly to add some more uniqueness to antagonist roles since a lot of them can be played by just killing people in your way, and this includes Space Ninjas.

## Spider Clan Code

All Space Ninjas will now have a Spider Clan Code they will have to live by, and this thus affects gameplay substantially by imposing certain restrictions.
- The already existing one, being the inability to shoot ranged weapons, will be included in this Code.
- The second restriction is making it so the Space Ninjas can no longer tend to their own wounds, as it would be preferred that they are not even spotted during their mission. To compensate, Space Ninjas will now have increased passive regeneration as well as faster bleed recovery that far exceeds what normal crewmates could ever achieve due to their bio-engineered bodies.

## New Items & Mechanics

### Flavour Additions

- The Space Ninja now comes with an adequately themed satchel, as well as a katana sheath.
- Equipping the space ninja helmet is now an instantaneous toggle action that comes with the space ninja suit.

### Ability Additions
- The Space Ninja can now fabricate ninja caltrops, a variant of ninja throwing stars with an emphasis on piercing damage, will puncture through most footwear if dropped on the ground, exceptions being: space ninja shoes, jackboots, and combat boots.
- The ninja visor can now alternate between normal vision and night vision.

### Objective Mechanics

- All stealing objectives can now only be performed with a specialized item that is dropped by the ninja upon death, unlike previously where they only used their gloves -This allows the crew to regain their losses.
- A strongbox for Cargo containing all their deposited spesos, can be the target of one of the Space Ninja's objectives - An alternative to "Steal X technologies".
- An AI law board that can be used for one of the Space Ninja's objectives - An alternative to "Detonate your spider charge".

## Balance Changes

### Nerfs
- Lower the energy katana's one-handed damage.
- Lower the ninja throwing star's piercing damage to compensate for the newly added ninja caltrops.
- Lower the ninja throwing star's stamina damage.
- [Fix ninja stunlocking](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/pull/33244)

### Buffs
- The ninja throwing stars and ninja caltrops can be stacked, as well as thrown in spreads.
- The energy katana's slash rate is slightly faster than it was previously when one-handed to compensate for it's damage loss.
- When phased, the Space Ninja is able to discreetly steal from people, at the cost of a longer action duration.
- Space Ninjas now come outfitted with a ninja headset as per Alwayswannahunt's PR, green encryption key included.
- Grants the ability to wield the energy katana for a hard-hitting swing, at the cost of a slower slash rate.
