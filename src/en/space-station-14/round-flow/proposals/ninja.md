[Ninja headset & Agent ID improvement PR](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/pull/32841) 

## Overview

This proposal is aimed towards addressing some issues that Space Ninjas currently possess, as well as adding some extra flavour and other content.</p>
<p>New abilities and interactions have been added to better fit with the stealth-based gameplay the Space Ninja should have had. They now also come with an adequately themed satchel and a katana sheath, as well as a brand new ninja headset as per Alwayswannahunt's PR.</p>
<p>The Space Ninja's weapons have gotten a slight nerf as to not make them as prone to murder-boning.
