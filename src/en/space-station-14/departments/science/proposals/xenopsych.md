## Overview

This document strives to expand on current Anomalous Research not only by introducing more hands-on content in the form of additional anomaly interactions (ie. objectives) but also by thouroughly expanding on Anomalous Infections with the addition of new abilities and new items and fortifying the technology-unlocks system!

## Background

Science, as it stands, is quite possibly one of the better departments in terms of general gameplay, but I find some areas (Most of which are addressed in this document) lacking compared to the up and coming Xeno-Archeology rework.

Anomalous Research is also one of the least wished tasks for most scientists too, good as it is, as past a certain point it stops being novel and more of a chore (A similar argument could be made for current Xeno-Archeology, but in that case there is much higher variety and "randomness", the latter of which is something this game lives off of).

## Features to be added

### Pt.1 - Anomalous Research (Entities)

- Players no longer get the particle types' effects spoon-fed to them, rather they will have to note it down themselves based on the anomaly's behaviour (Existing types and their uses remain untouched); a UI rework of the anomaly scanner would therefore be necessary.

- Players will get a list of objectives of 3-4 objectives for each anomaly they scan, some of which reward a high number of points (At a higher risk), these are so that whilst scanning they actually perform actions worthy of the word _Research_, as it would act as if they were actually studying the anomaly; some of these objectives could be as follows:

    - Severe the anomaly up to X% (Low reward, low risk)
    - Have the anomaly stable for X minutes (Medium reward, low risk, moderate effort)
    - Transform the anomaly X times (Low reward, low risk)
    - Decay the anomaly (Uncommon) (Medium reward, low risk, moderate effort)
    - Crit the anomaly (Rare) (High reward, high risk)

*The current hands-off point-making method remains, these objectives would simply be extras that offer additional points and unlock certain technologies for research (More on this later).

- Reworked anomaly crits, as to be much less destructive _while_ still remaining troublesome; a suggestion:

    - Whenever an ice anomaly crits, it explodes in a cloud of extremely cold gas, freezing all tiles, walls, and players in an area, those of which get instantly frozen and require thawing from someone outside, if not thawed in time they freeze to death.

### Pt.2 - Anomalous Research (Infections)

- Anomalous Infection research now also doesn't have the particle types' effects mentioned right away, requiring the player to test it on the host.

- You can now get "permanent" abilities if the anomaly's needs are met (Objectives, those of which are directly correlated to your alignment, if crew-aligned, passive objectives that might hurt only you, if antagonistical, more volatile ones, although the possibility for passive objectives is still on the table as an antagonist) as well as have it stable for a sufficient amount of time, a process I like to call "Anomalous Assimilation", these so called anomalous needs could be:

    - Eat X ice creams (Ice anomaly's, passive)
    - Kill someone with a fire-based weapon (Fire anomaly's, antagonistical)
    - Eat X raw meat (Meat anomaly's, passive)
    - Cut X vending machine's Y wire (Technological anomaly's, passive or antagonistical)
    - Stay in complete darkness for X minutes (Shadow anomaly's, passive)

- The existing abilities would remain to exist, but rather than keeping them forever they'd be only be present during the assimilation process, as after they'd be discarded for direct upgrades (The aforemention abilities may also have to be tweaked to be more logical downgrades rather than sidegrades), some examples of these being:

- <b>Bluespace</b>
    - Short-distance teleportation to a location on-screen at the player's discretion (High cooldown)
- <b>Meat</b>
    - DNA-changing (Very high cooldown)
    - The ability to eat meat in any state, be it raw, cooked, or rotten (Passive)
- <b>Technological</b>
    - EMAG at will (Very high cooldown)
    - Bolt/Unbolting at will (High cooldown)

*To compensate, some of the aforementioned anomalous infection types could have harder objectives dependent on how good their abilities are, meaning Meat's would be easier than Technological's, albeit still require an effort.

- Upon completing the hosting anomaly's entire checklist, the subsequent anomaly would be much harder to remove, as well as doing so would inevitably result in the player's death (Whether it be by Decay or by Crit, as the anomaly would be entirely assimilated and hence technically be the player themselves).

- Two new items have been added that are directly related to Anomalous Infection research, these being:

    - The "A.T.B." (Anomalous Transmission Blocker) it acts as a "counterweight" to this Anomalous Infections ability buff by blocking any and all Anomalous Infection abilities (Whether the assimilation process has been complete or not), it's put on the head, and once equipped, the wearer will either have to ask an outsider to take it off (Moderately long do-after) or take it off themselves (Very long do-after, similarly to electropacks), can be unlocked via Experimental in the R&D console:
    - The "anopen", an item that can be used by Anomalous Infection hosts to self-treat themselves, it is, however, only available via Supply, effectively adding to Sci-Cargo's inter-departmental interactions.

### Technology Unlocks

- Some technologies now start locked behind anomaly research, the only way to unlock them being via the completion of the previously anomaly research objectives; some of these locked technologies (And their subsequent assigned anomalies) could be:

    - <b>Bluespace</b> - Bluespace Storage, includes near-bottomless backwear with the use of bluespace technology (Experimental)
    - <b>Gravity</b> - Anomalous Magnetism, includes enhanced variants of magboots due to a better understanding of the gravitational anomaly (Experimental) 
    - <b>Electricity</b> - Advanced Defibrillation, includes an upgraded defibrillator that can not only act as a viable offensive weapon but also revive much more quickly (Civillian Services)

### Miscellaneous Additions & Changes

- <b>UI</b>
    - Once infected with an anomaly, the chat message indicating so will be the colour correspondent to the anomaly type's, eg. if the host is bearing a pyroclastic anomaly, the message will be orange, if an ice anomaly, bright blue.

- <b>QoL</b>
    - Make the anomaly scanner's scan faster and make it able to remain open regardless of the player's distance to the anomaly (The severity and stability would, however, stop updating, and indicate a message warning so)
    - Anomaly Research should be renamed to "Xeno-Psychology" as to better fit with the other scientific areas' naming conventions (Xeno-Archeology & Xeno-Biology); the name may however, be up to debate, as even though I think Xeno-Psychology is great it's far from perfect.
