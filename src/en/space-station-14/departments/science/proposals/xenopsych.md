## Overview

This document strives to expand on current Anomalous Research by introducing more hands-on mechanics and a generally more refined and player-driven experience.

## Background

Science, as it stands, is quite possibly one of the better departments in terms of general gameplay, but I find some areas (Those of which are addressed in this document) lacking compared to the up and coming Xeno-Archeology rework.

Anomalous Research is also one of the least wished for roles for most scientists too, good as it is, as past a certain point it stops being novel and more of a chore (A similar argument could be made for current Xeno-Archeology, but in that case there is much higher variety and "randomness", the latter of which is something this game lives off of).

## Features to be added

### Anomalous Research & Player-agency Additions

- Players no longer get the particle types' effects spoon-fed to them, rather they will have to note it down themselves based on the anomaly's behaviour (Existing types and their uses remain untouched).
- Players will get a list of objectives of 3-4 objectives for each anomaly they scan, some of which reward a high number of points (At a higher risk), these are so that whilst scanning they actually perform actions worthy of the word _Research_, as it would act as if they were actually studying the anomaly; some of these objectives could be as follows:

1. Severe the anomaly up to X% (Low reward, low risk)
2. Have the anomaly stable for X minutes (Medium reward, low risk, moderate effort)
3. Transform the anomaly X times (Low reward, low risk)
4. Decay the anomaly (Uncommon) (Medium reward, low risk, moderate effort)
5. Crit the anomaly (Rare) (High reward, high risk)

*The current hands-off point-making method would remain, these would simply be "extras" on-top to spice up gameplay.

- Completion of one's list would _also_ result in unlocking a previously locked technology for research (ie. still requires research points) directly related to it; examples are as follows:

1. <b>Bluespace</b> - Bluespace Storage, includes near-bottomless backwear with the use of bluespace technology (T3 - Experimental)
2. <b>Gravity</b> - Anomalous Magnetism, includes enchanced variants of magboots due to a better understanding of the gravitational anomaly (T3 - Experimental) 
3. <b>Electricity</b> - Advanced Defibrillation, includes an upgraded defibrillator that can not only act as a viable offensive weapon, but also revives much more quickly (T3 - Civillian Services) 

- Reworked anomaly crits, as to be much less destructive _while_ still remaining troublesome; a suggestion:

1. Whenever an ice anomaly crits, it explodes in a cloud of extremely cold gas, freezing all tiles, walls, and players in an area, those of which get instantly frozen and require thawing from someone outside.

### (Better) Anomalous Infections

- Making it so now you get "permanent" abilities if the anomaly's needs are met (Objectives, those of which are directly correlated to your alignment, if crew-aligned, passive objectives that might hurt only you, if antagonistical, more volatile ones, although the possibility for passive objectives is still on the table as an antagonist), an effect I like to call "Anomalous Assimilation", these could be:

1. Eat X ice creams (Ice anomaly's, passive)
2. Kill someone with a fire weapon (Fire anomaly's, antagonistical)
3. Eat X raw meat (Meat anomaly's, passive)
4. Cut X vending machine's Y wire (Technological anomaly's, passive or antagonistical)
5. Stay in complete darkness for X minutes (Shadow anomaly's, passive)

The aforementioned anomalous infection would also have to be stable for a sufficient amount of time; the abilities to be added for some anomaly types could be as follows (Keep in mind pulsing abilities would remain, but as _imperfect_ ability forms, meaning they offer a similar effect but in a much weaker manner):

1. <b>Bluespace</b> - Short-distance teleportation (High cooldown)
2. <b>Meat</b> - DNA-changing (Very high cooldown)
3. <b>Technological</b> - EMAG at will (Very high cooldown), Bolt/Unbolting at will (High cooldown)

*To compensate, some of the aforementioned anomalous infection types could have harder objectives dependent on how good their abilities are, meaning Meat's would be easier than Technological's, albeit still require an effort.

Upon completing the hosting anomaly's entire checklist, the subsequent anomaly would be much harder to remove, as well as doing so would inevitably result in the player's death (Whether it be by Decay or by Crit, as the anomaly would be entirely assimilated and hence technically be the player themselves).

### Additional Additions

<b>UI</b> - A way to have the players be able to note down what particle type does what as per the first suggestion (Perhaps a selectable list of each effect type for each particle?) 

<b>UI</b> - Once infected with an anomaly, the chat message indicating so will be the colour correspondent to the anomaly type, eg. if the host is bearing a pyroclastic anomaly, the message will be orange, if an ice anomaly, bright blue.

<b>QoL</b> - Make the anomaly scanner is now considerably faster and be able to remain open regardless of the player's distance to the anomaly's type (The severity and stability would, however, stop updating, and indicate a message warning so)
